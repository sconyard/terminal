        "DETAILS:",
        "Subject exhibits extraordinary **thermal resistance**. Conventional heat-based sterilization techniques proved entirely ineffective, even under sustained exposure beyond 1800°C. The outer dermal layer remains intact, showing no signs of charring or breakdown.",
        "",
        "However, subject integrity is not absolute. Repeated exposure to acidic compounds induces noticeable structural weakening. Microscopic fissures appear to propagate along biologically 'engineered' lines within the tissue—these fractures spread progressively, resulting in cascading failures of the skeletal structure. Specimens subjected to prolonged acid baths liquefy internally after 4-7 minutes, though the outer form remains disturbingly intact.",
        "",
        "NOTES:",
        "The physiology of the specimen is unlike any organism I have studied. Its resilience borders on the impossible—no carbon-based life should exhibit such properties. Is it engineered? Evolved for war? I cannot say, but this organism feels *designed*.",
        "",
        "I attempted treatment out of professional obligation. The injuries, however, were clearly **unsurvivable**—tissue loss and internal hemorrhaging beyond any conceivable repair. It did not respond to anesthetics or stimulants, though the body displayed sporadic muscular contractions post-mortem.",
        "",
        "RECOMMENDATION:",
        "Containment is the only viable course of action. Any efforts at 'treatment' are meaningless, and extended contact presents a clear biological hazard. The focus must shift to understanding and controlling its unique properties.",

          "AUTHOR: Dr. Victoria Nguen, Biomechanical Research Lead",
          "",
          "DETAILS:",
          "Specimen remains biologically fascinating but uncooperative. Attempts to extract viable samples have proven arduous. Its cellular structure actively resists external interference, rapidly neutralizing cutting tools and chemical agents.",
          "",
          "Repeated exposure to acid (HCl variant) reveals points of failure along stress fractures, suggesting an internal lattice-like network designed to distribute damage. Yet, even as degradation begins, the specimen exhibits a kind of **reactive healing**, as if the body prioritizes structural cohesion over organ preservation.",
          "",
          "NOTES:",
          "Every fiber of its being suggests **purpose**—a machine in flesh. Whether this is natural evolution or deliberate engineering eludes me, but it demands our full scientific attention.",
          "",
          "Its silence is unnerving. While other organisms cry out in pain, this one simply... persists. There is no struggle, no life as we understand it. The question remains: is it alive, or merely operating?",
          "",
          "RECOMMENDATION:",
          "Further autopsy work should focus on isolating its reactive processes. Understanding its structural resilience could have profound military and industrial applications.",

          "DETAILS:",
          "The subject—if I can even call it that—was brought to me as a curiosity. Its body was broken, scorched, and corroded, and yet it still **moved**. Not in anger or fear, but in something quieter. Reflex? Instinct? I can’t say.",
          "",
          "I administered sedatives, knowing they would likely do nothing. I applied stabilizers and tried to address the acidic damage, futile though it was. But the creature—no, *being*—remained still as I worked, as if it understood my intent. Its body twitched once, in a way I can only describe as resignation.",
          "",
          "NOTES:",
          "I wonder, does it feel pain? Or sorrow? If this is an engineered creation, was it abandoned like we now abandon this station? I can’t help but feel it deserved more than to be dissected and discarded.",

          "DETAILS:",
          "Subject tissue samples exhibit aggressive behavior under observation. Degradation occurs when exposed to acidic compounds, but fragments display a **self-replicating quality** before collapse. Containment must be absolute. Even small remnants could pose biological risks.",
          "",
          "Thermal resistance continues to baffle analysis. Specimen was exposed to temperatures exceeding 2100°C with no observable damage. The implications are staggering—this creature is either an evolutionary outlier or something far worse.",
