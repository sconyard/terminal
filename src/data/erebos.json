        "However, subject integrity is not absolute. Repeated exposure to acidic compounds induces noticeable structural weakening. Microscopic fissures appear to propagate along biologically 'engineered' lines within the tissue—these fractures spread progressively, resulting in cascading failures of the skeletal structure. Specimens subjected to prolonged acid baths liquefy internally after 4-7 minutes, though the outer form remains disturbingly intact.",

        "NOTES:",
